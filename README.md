# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This application is a simple calendar that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. 

In this daily planner,
- the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
- there are time blocks for standard business hours
- each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past (grey), present (red), or future (green)
- an event can be entered and saved for that time block
- if the page is refreshed, the saved events remain in the planner/time block
